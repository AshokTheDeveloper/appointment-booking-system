## Assumptions:
Here are some key assumptions and design decisions made while developing this Prenatal Care Appointment Booking System:

1. Doctor's Working Hours are Fixed:

   - Each doctor has predefined working hours (e.g., 9 AM - 5 PM).
   - These hours are set during doctor creation and are used to determine available appointment slots.
2. Appointment Durations are Consistent:

   - Each appointment has a fixed duration, set when booking an appointment.
The system ensures appointments do not overlap.
3. Users Book One Slot at a Time:

    - A user cannot book multiple slots at once.
Each booking request is processed separately to prevent conflicts.
Time Zones & Date Handling:

4. No User Authentication in Basic Version:
   - Authentication (e.g., login, role-based access) is not required for booking appointments in the basic version.
However, it can be implemented later for enhanced security.
