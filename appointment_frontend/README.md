## Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
``` bash
cd myapp
```
2. Install Depedencies:
``` bash
npm install
```
3. Start the server
``` bash
npm run dev
```
## Packages installed
Frontend Dependencies & Setup
The frontend of this application is built using React and powered by Vite for fast development and optimized builds.

Dependencies
The package.json includes the following dependencies:

### UI & Styling:

- bootstrap: For responsive and modern UI components.
- react-icons: Provides scalable vector icons.
### Date & Time Handling:

- date-fns: A modern JavaScript date utility library.
### Routing & Navigation:

- react-router-dom: Enables client-side routing.
### User Experience Enhancements:

- react-toastify: Provides toast notifications for better user feedback.
- react-spinners: Displays loading animations.

### Lazy Loading implemented
To improve performance and optimize the initial load time, this application implements lazy loading using React's lazy and Suspense.

### App Component
``` jsx
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Notification from "./components/Notifications/Notifications";
import Loading from "./components/Loading/Loading";
import "./App.css";

const Home = lazy(() => import("./components/Home/Home"));
const DoctorDetails = lazy(() =>
  import("./components/DoctorDetails/DoctorDetails")
);
const Appointments = lazy(() =>
  import("./components/Appointments/Appointments")
);

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Notification />
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <Routes>
          <Route exact path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route exact path="/doctor/:id" element={<DoctorDetails />} />
          <Route exact path="/appointments" element={<Appointments />} />
        </Routes>
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;

```


## Design Decisions
### Tech Stack Choice:
- Backend: Node.js & Express for API handling.
- Database: MongoDB for flexible data storage, enabling efficient queries.
- Frontend: React for a dynamic and interactive UI.
 - `Lazy Loading`: Implemented for React components using React.lazy() and Suspense to improve performance.
- `State Management`: Minimal external state management React's built-in state and useContext (if needed) were prioritized.
- `API Design`:
RESTful API structure for clarity and scalability.
Separate endpoints for doctors, appointments, and available slots.
- `Error Handling`:
    - Backend APIs return meaningful error messages.
    - Frontend displays user-friendly notifications using react-toastify.
- `Responsive UI`: The frontend is built with React and Bootstrap to ensure mobile-friendly design.
- `React Loader`: Implemented react loader spinner to handle api state
